# C++ Investment-Banking-Calculator

The Investment Banking Calculator was created with C++. 

The functionality of the banking calculator includes prompting customers for information regarding an initial investment amount. From there, customers can supply additional information such as the desired monthly deposit, the annual interest, and the number of years that the investment will grow. The calculator can then calculate the return on investment with a year end balance and year end earned interest.
